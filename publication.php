              <h3>Short-Term Versus Long-Term Effects of Forced Displacement</h3>
            </header>

                <h4>Abstract</h4>
              
              <p align="justify">This study focuses on the conceptual frameworks and empirical evidence that underscore forced displacement. In particular, the study explores development-induced displacement and summarises evidence of its short-term and long-terms effects from around the developing world. Evidence in the literature points out to adverse short-term effects among displacees that normalise over the long run. In the short term, adverse psychological, income and cultural factors affect individual and family security and tend to make displacees worse off compared to non-displaced households. In the long term, however, adaptability among displacees and state mechanisms may help displacees normalise and settle down especially if adequate compensation policies are sanctioned.</p>

              <h3>In search of Quality: A study on elementary education in India </a></h3>
            </header>
            <section class="content">
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p align="justify">This study investigates the quality of education attained by students in rural areas of different states in India. The government of India has focused on fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals, children should be able to attain at least primary education, neglecting learning achievement. We examine quality of education by computing an index, Learning Achievement Index (LAI) based on data from Annual Status of Education Report(ASER). We compute two more indices based on quality of infrastructure provided and quality of teachers and ranked the states accordingly. We look for the impact of expenditure by the Indian Government in quality provisions on the Learning Achievement Index(LAI). The results show certain positive and negative impacts, most importantly showing that mother’s education has a significant impact on the child’s learning achievement. Some of the results support our expectations and we explain why some of our hypothesis was invalidated by the LAI based analysis.</p>

             <h2>Making data reusable: lessons learned from replications of impact evaluations</h2>

<section class="content">
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
              <p align="justify">The study aims to check the reusability of impact evaluation data by verifying the results presented in published 3ie reports. In order to verify results, we conduct push button replications on the original data and code submitted by the authors. We use the push button replication protocol developed at 3ie to determine the level of comparability of the replication results to the original findings. Our sample includes closed 3ie-funded impact evaluations commissioned between 2008 and 2018. Of the 74 studies in our sample, we successfully reproduced results from 38 studies (51%). 24 (32%) studies were categorized as incomplete and 12 (16%) studies were categorized as having major differences. The cumulative replication rate in 2018 increased to 51%, as compared to the below-40% replication rate in previous years. Overall, on average, it took about 3 hours to complete the replication of a single impact evaluation. Evidence from impact evaluations are credible when it is verifiable. Our findings suggest that greater attention is needed to ensure the reliability and reusability of evidence. We recommend push button replications as a tested method to ascertain the credibility of findings.</p>
